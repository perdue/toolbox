	Program RKIN performs relativistic kinematic calculations for two-body
nuclear reactions.  The program is designed for simple interactive use.  The
user is prompted for input such as incident lab energies, angles, excitation
energies, etc.
 
	The reaction should be entered in the usual form A(a,b)B.  Nuclei are
specified by their atomic number and symbol, e.g. 27Al.  Proton, neutron, 
deuteron, triton, alpha particle, gamma ray, and electron may be abbreviated
by p, n, d, t, a, g, and e respectively.  The residual nucleus need not be 
specified.  Letters may be entered in either upper or lower case.  If an error
or inconsistency is detected, the program will request that the code be retyped.
 
	The output appears in a file RKIN.OUT.  Two formats are available.  The
standard output format has been maintained for compatibility with earlier
versions of the program.  Also, this format must be used if the results are to
be plotted by program PLOTKIN.
 
	An alternative output is also available.  It suppresses printing of the
second kinematic solution except when this solution is non-zero.  Also, when the
ejectile is charged, the range of the particle in silicon is calculated.  The
user also may specify the thicknesses of up to two silicon surface-barrier
detectors and the energy deposition for these detectors is calculated.
Additionally, this format differs from the standard in that the momentum
transfer and the kinematic shift are calculated and that the output
is oragnized by angle rather than by the final state of the residual nucleus.

	Currently (8/82), the program is believed to be bug-free.  Comments and
reports of any errors should be directed to Bennett Karp.

	A modification has been added to RKIN that will prevent it
from crashing when the scattering angle is 180 degrees.  In some cases,
it had been failing. - BCK
