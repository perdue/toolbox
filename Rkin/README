 libRkin.so: An object-oriented interface library to the rkin Fortran 
             library. This C++ code is a wrapper for the Fortran code.
             This shared object library allows the use of rkin inside
             a C++ program.  This library was based on the rkin.for
             code modified by Sean Stave.  I have added the class 
             interface and a Makefile to compile the code.

 - Rkin looks for a copy of ASS83A.DAT in the current directory.  So copy it 
   to your working directory or symlink to it from your working directory.


 - Look at howto_Rkin.cxx for how to use the Rkin class.
   Look at Rkin.h to see the public methods available.
